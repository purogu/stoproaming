# Stop Roaming
A mod that stops mobs from roaming around by altering their AI.

Mobs can still run when hit, follow food, etc, but they won't roam aimlessly.

By default, the modification applies to farm animals (cows, chicken, sheep, pigs), but can be adjusted in the server config to apply to any set of MobEntity.
